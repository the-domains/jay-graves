This is my great-grandfather J.W. Graves.  I really don't know a thing about him, but that is a story for another day....

My parents gave me this picture for Christmas.  The picture dates back to appropriately 1910 and is likely somewhere near Birmingham.Great Grandfather J.W. built the cable tool drilling rig himself.  From scratch. 

In the modern world we don't do these kinds of things anymore. I think we should, or at least try the equivalent with the cookie-cutter tools we've been given today.

I'm hanging this picture in my office for two reasons.  One is to remind me to build.  Build things of value that provide value.  _Building is creating._ The other reason is to remind me that nothing we do today is really that hard.  We have AC and we have the cloud.  _Today ain't nothing._
